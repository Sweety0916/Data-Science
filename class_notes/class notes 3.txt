to analyse the dataa to certain plain if the patern may be form difficult if data form row formate thus to over come this data visulation come into 
play it provides good fictorial representation of the data which make its easy to undersatnd and analyse




************************
 MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAY
we cannot write 2-d array in heap as new int[n][m]
array of integer pointer

for storing arry in pointer in heap we use syntax
int *p=new int[n]

and for storing an 2-d array of integer pointer in heap 

int **p=new int *[n]

************************
int **p=new int*[n];
for(init i=0;i<n;i++){
p[i]=new int[m];
for(int j=0;j<m;j++){
cin>>p[i][j];}
}
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
delete [] p[i];// whenever we are using new in heap we have to use 
// delete keyword  }
}
delete [] p;// builtin type to  dlt array

* in heap we can store int and int array also

we use keyword










in order and pre order
